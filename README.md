# Dart Code Solutions: 22 Programming Challenges

Welcome to the **Dart Code Solutions** repository, where you will find efficient solutions to 22 fundamental programming questions written in the **Dart programming language**. These questions are designed to strengthen your understanding of core Dart concepts, including **Lists**, **Maps**, **conditional statements**, and **functional methods** like `where()` and `map()`.

## Problem Set Overview

Below is the list of 22 programming challenges, each targeting specific concepts in Dart:

1. **Q1**: Create a list of names and print all names using a list.
2. **Q2**: Create an empty list of type `String` called `days`. Use the `add()` method to populate it with the 7 days of the week and print the list.
3. **Q3**: Create a list of days and remove one element at a time starting from the end of the list.
4. **Q4**: Create a list of numbers and write a program to find the smallest and largest number in the list.
5. **Q5**: Create a map with `name` and `phone` keys. Use `where()` to filter keys with a length of 4.
6. **Q6**: Create a `world` map containing nested maps of countries. Access and print the capital and currency of a specified country.
7. **Q7**: Check if a specific key exists in a map. Update the key’s value or add it if it doesn’t exist. Print the updated map.
8. **Q8**: Remove all `false` values from a list of maps using methods like `removeWhere()` or `retainWhere()`.
9. **Q9**: Given a list of integers, write code to find and return the maximum value in the list.
10. **Q10**: Write Dart code that removes duplicates from a list of strings and returns a new list.
11. **Q11**: Write code that takes a list and an integer `n`, and prints a new list containing the first `n` elements of the original list.
12. **Q12**: Write a program that reverses a list of strings without modifying the original list.
13. **Q13**: Given a list of integers, create a new list containing only unique elements.
14. **Q14**: Write code that sorts a list of integers in ascending order without changing the original list.
15. **Q15**: Use the `where()` method to filter out negative numbers from a list and print only the positive numbers.
16. **Q16**: Use the `where()` method to filter out odd numbers from a list and print only the even numbers.
17. **Q17**: Write code using the `map()` method to square each value in a list of integers and return the resulting list.
18. **Q18**: Create a map `person` with keys `name`, `age`, and `isStudent`. Check if the person is both a student and older than 18 years.
19. **Q19**: Given a map representing a product (`name`, `price`, `quantity`), check if the product is in stock and print the result.
20. **Q20**: Create a map `car` with keys `brand`, `color`, and `isSedan`. Check if the car is a red sedan.
21. **Q21**: Given a map representing a user (`name`, `isAdmin`, `isActive`), verify if the user is both active and an admin.
22. **Q22**: Create a map representing a shopping cart (keys as product names and values as quantities). Check if a product named **"Apple"** exists in the cart.
